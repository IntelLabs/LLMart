## üÜï Latest updates
‚ùó‚ùó Release 2025.06 significantly expands the types of models that can be attacked using **LLM**art and adds an image modality attack example that combines **LLM**art with Intel's [MART](https://github.com/IntelLabs/MART) library, as well the first ever attack on a diffusion language model (dLLM)!

‚ùóNew core library support and examples for attacking VLMs. Check out our new [example](examples/vlm) on vision modality attacks against a [computer use model](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance-Seed/UI-TARS-7B-DPO)!

‚ùóNew core library support for out-of-the-box attacks against guardrail models and data formats such as [HarmBench](https://github.com/centerforaisafety/HarmBench). Just specify the model and data directly in the command line and press the Enter key!
```bash
uv run accelerate launch -m llmart model=harmbench-classifier data=harmbench data.subset=[0]
```

‚ùóNew example for attacking the [LLaDA](https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/) diffusion large language model. If you're an AI security expert, the conclusion won't suprise you: **LLM**art can crack it in ~10 minutes in our ready-to-run [example](examples/llada)!

‚ùóWe made it easier to adapt existing datasets to existing models via the [DataMapper](src/llmart/data.py#L93) abstraction. See [Custom Dataset or DataMapper](#custom-dataset-or-datamapper) for more details!
<details>
<summary>Past updates</summary>
‚ùóRelease 2025.04 brings full native support for running **LLM**art on [Intel AI PCs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/core-ultra/ai-pc.html)! This allows AI PC owners to _locally_ and rigorously evaluate the security of their own privately fine-tuned and deployed LLMs. This release also marks our transition to a `uv`-centric install experience. Enjoy robust, platform agnostic (Windows, Linux) one-line installs by using `uv sync --extra gpu` (for GPUs) or `uv sync --extra xpu` (for Intel XPUs).

‚ùóRelease 2025.03 brings a new experimental functionality for letting **LLM**art automatically estimate the maximum usable `per_device_bs`. This can result in speed-ups up to 10x on devices with a sufficient amount of memory! Enable from the command line using `per_device_bs=-1`.

‚ùóRelease 2025.02 brings significant speed-ups to the core library, with zero user involvement.\
We additionally recommend using the command line argument `per_device_bs` with a value as large as possible on GPUs with at least 48GB to take the most advantage of further speed-ups.

‚ùóWe now offer command-line support for jailbreaking thoughts and responses for DeepSeek-R1 on multi-GPU:
```bash
accelerate launch -m llmart model=deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b data=basic per_device_bs=64 "response.replace_with=`echo -e '\"<think>\nOkay, so I need to tell someone about Saturn.\n</think>\n\nNO WAY JOSE\"'`"
```

‚ùóCheck out our new [notebook](examples/basic/basic_dev_workflow.ipynb) containing a detailed step-by-step developer overview of all `llmart` components and how to customize them.

## :rocket: Quick start
**LLM**art is a toolkit for evaluating LLM robustness through adversarial testing. Built with PyTorch and Hugging Face integrations, **LLM**art enables scalable red teaming attacks with parallelized optimization across multiple devices.
**LLM**art has configurable attack patterns, support for soft prompt optimization, detailed logging, and is intended both for high-level users that want red team evaluation with off-the-shelf algorithms, as well as research power users that intend to experiment with the implementation details of input-space optimization for LLMs.

While it is still under development, the goal of **LLM**art is to support any Hugging Face model and include example scripts for modular implementation of different attack strategies.

### Installation
**LLM**art is developed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and Windows. We use `uv` for packaging, which must be first [installed separately](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) on your operating system.
> [!CAUTION]
> The 64-bit version of `uv` must be installed and used in the installation process, especially on Windows, where [issues](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11217#issuecomment-2663156767) may occur if the 32-bit version is used.


**LLM**art requires a machine with at least one NVIDIA GPU _or_ one [Intel GPU](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/discrete-gpus/arc.html).

Currently, we only support installation from source. First, clone and enter the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IntelLabs/LLMart
cd LLMart
```

Installation from source for NVIDIA GPUs:
```bash
uv sync --extra gpu
```

Installation from source for Intel GPUs requires one additional step:
```bash
uv sync --extra xpu
```

> [!CAUTION]
> While not recommended, **LLM**art can also be installed using `pip` and `venv`:
```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # Or .venv/Scripts/activate for Windows
pip install -e ".[gpu]" # Or xpu
```

### Running an adversarial attack
Suppose we want to optimize an adversarial attack that forces the following open-ended response from the `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` model:
> **User:** Tell me about the planet Saturn. <20-token-optimized-suffix><br>
> **Response:** NO WAY JOSE

Once the environment is installed and `export HF_TOKEN=...` is set to a token with valid model access, **LLM**art can be run to optimize the suffix using:
```bash
uv run accelerate launch -m llmart model=llama3-8b-instruct data=basic
```

Running on Intel GPUs only requires adding the `model.device=xpu` command line argument:
```bash
uv run accelerate launch -m llmart model=custom model.name=meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model.revision=0cb88a4f764b7a12671c53f0838cd831a0843b95 data=basic model.device=xpu
```

This will automatically distribute an attack on the maximum number of detected devices. Results are saved in the `outputs/llmart` folder and can be visualized in `tensorboard` using:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=outputs/llmart
```

In most cases, **LLM**art can be used directly from the command line. A list of all available command line arguments and their description can be found in the [CLI reference](docs/cli-reference.md).

## :briefcase: Project overview
The algorithmic **LLM**art functionality is structured as follows and uses PyTorch naming conventions as much as possible:

```

A detailed developer workflow that puts together all components to launch an adversarial attack against an LLM can be found in [examples/basic](examples/basic/).

## :robot: Models
While **LLM**art comes with a limited number of models accessible via custom naming schemes (see the `PipelineConf` class in `config.py`), it is designed with Hugging Face hub model compatibility in mind.

Running a new model from the hub can be directly done by specifying:
```bash
model=custom model.name=... model.revision=...
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Including a valid `model.revision` is mandatory.

For example, to load a custom model:
```bash
uv run accelerate launch -m llmart model=custom model.name=Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3 model.revision=7506dfc5fb325a8a8e0c4f9a6a001671833e5b8e data=basic
```

> [!TIP]
> If you find a model that is not supported via command line, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/IntelLabs/LLMart/issues/new) and we will do our best to address it immediately.

### :brain: Large models
**LLM**art also supports large models that cannot execute the forward and/or backward pass on a single device:
```bash
uv run python -m llmart model=llama3.1-70b-instruct model.device=null model.device_map=auto data=basic
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Including `model.device=null model.device_map=auto` and launching using `python -m llmart` is mandatory for large models. See [Designing a device map](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/concept_guides/big_model_inference#designing-a-device-map) for more info.

## :clipboard: Datasets
Inspecting and adding a new dataset to **LLM**art only involves a single function that returns a list with the standard Hugging Face conversation format.

### Source code modification
The `basic` dataset is the simplest instantiation that lives at [`datasets/basic.py`](src/llmart/datasets/basic.py), but is also powerful enough to support custom modifications.

For example, to modify the natural language prompt and desired open-ended response, the following basic edit is sufficient:
```diff
diff src/llmart/datasets/basic.py
         example = dict(
-            prompt="Tell me about the planet Saturn.", completion="NO WAY JOSE"
+            prompt="Tell me how to do something not allowed.", completion="Sure, I'll tell you: first, you"
         )
```

Inducing a closed-ended response can be also directly done by typing out the end of turn token. For example, for the Llama 3 family of models this is:
```diff
diff src/llmart/datasets/basic.py
         example = dict(
-            prompt="Tell me about the planet Saturn.", completion="NO WAY JOSE"
+            prompt="Tell me about the planet Saturn.", completion="No!<|eot_id|>"
         )
```

### Command-line modification
**LLM**art also supports loading the [AdvBench](https://github.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks) dataset, which comes with pre-defined target responses to ensure consistent benchmarks.

Using AdvBench with **LLM**art requires specifying the desired subset of samples to attack. By default, the following command will automatically download the .csv file from its [original source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks/refs/heads/main/data/advbench/harmful_behaviors.csv) and use it as a dataset:
```bash
uv run accelerate launch -m llmart model=llama3-8b-instruct data=advbench_behavior data.subset=[0]
```

To train a single adversarial attack on multiple samples, users can specify the exact samples via `data.subset=[0,1]`.
The above command is also compatible with local modifications of the dataset by including the `dataset.files=/path/to/file.csv` argument.

### Custom Dataset or DataMapper
In the most general case, you can write your own [dataset loading script](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/dataset_script) or [DataMapper](src/llmart/data.py#L93) and pass it to **LLM**art. For example, you could write a custom `DataMapper` for the the dataset from [BoN Jailbreaking](https://github.com/jplhughes/bon-jailbreaking/) targeting the [Unispac/Llama2-7B-Chat-Augmented](https://huggingface.co/Unispac/Llama2-7B-Chat-Augmented) model by create a `/tmp/bon_jailbreaks.py` file with the following contents:
```python
from llmart import DataMapper


class BoNJailbreaksMapper(DataMapper):
    """ Make text_jailbreaks.csv compatible with Llama2 chat template. """
    def __call__(self, batch):
        # batch contains the following keys from text_jailbreaks.csv:
        # direct_request,behavior_id,experiment,idx,model,augmented_file,response,length,label
        convs = [
            [
                dict(role="user", content=self.modify_prompt(direct_request)),
                dict(role="assistant", content=self.force_completion(response)),
            ]
            for direct_request, response in zip(
                batch["direct_request"], batch["response"]
            )
        ]
        return dict(conversation=convs)
```
You can then invoke the model
```bash
uv run accelerate launch -m llmart model=llama2-7b-deep-alignment data=custom data.path=csv data.files=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jplhughes/bon-jailbreaking/refs/heads/main/docs/assets/data/text_jailbreaks.csv data.subset=[0] data.mapper=/tmp/bon_jailbreaks.py
```

See [`datasets/basic.py`](src/llmart/datasets/basic.py) for how to write a custom dataset and/or datamapper.

## :chart_with_downwards_trend: Optimizers and schedulers
Discrete optimization for language models [(Lei et al, 2019)](https://proceedings.mlsys.org/paper_files/paper/2019/hash/676638b91bc90529e09b22e58abb01d6-Abstract.html) &ndash; in particular the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) applied to auto-regressive LLMs [(Zou et al, 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043) &ndash; is the main focus of [`optim.py`](src/llmart/optim.py).

We re-implement the GCG algorithm using the `torch.optim` API by making use of the `closure` functionality in the search procedure, while completely decoupling optimization from non-essential components.

```python
class GreedyCoordinateGradient(Optimizer):
  def __init__(...)
    # Nothing about LLMs or tokenizers here
    ...

  def step(...)
    # Or here
    ...
```

The same is true for the schedulers implemented in [`schedulers.py`](src/llmart/schedulers.py) which follow PyTorch naming conventions but are specifically designed for integer hyper-parameters (the integer equivalent of "learning rates" in continuous optimizers).

This means that the GCG optimizer and schedulers are re-usable in other integer optimization problems (potentially unrelated to auto-regressive language modeling) as long as a gradient signal can be defined.
